Prompt:

"Imagine a Windows desktop UI built with Streamlit for a Customer Feedback Analysis application. The interface should be user-friendly and visually organized. Include the following elements:

1. Text Input / Interaction Area:

A large multiline text box for users to enter feedback manually.

A voice input button to record spoken feedback, with a clear mechanism to start and stop recording.

Display the converted voice as text in the same text box.

2. NER / Sentiment / Classification Display:

A panel showing the detected named entities in the text.

Checkboxes or markers to indicate correctness of each detected entity.

Display the sentiment of the feedback (positive, neutral, negative), color-coded.

Display the classification result of the model (e.g., Complaint, Praise, Request, Other).

3. Dataset / Feedback Viewer:

A live table showing all recent feedback records. Each record should display:

Feedback text

Detected entities

Sentiment

Classification result

Include a filter option to sort or filter the table by sentiment, entity, or classification result.

Add a button to export the filtered records to CSV or Excel.

4. Action Buttons:

A Submit button for adding new feedback.

An optional Undo Last Action button to revert mistakes.

5. Notifications / Feedback:

A section for displaying confirmation messages when feedback is successfully added and analyzed.

Display error messages if there is a problem with input or model analysis.

6. Analytics / Visualization Panels:

A pie chart or bar chart showing the distribution of sentiment across feedback.

A bar chart showing the distribution of classification results.

A word cloud or simple chart showing the most frequent entities detected.

Design Style:

Clean, modern, and minimalistic layout.

Use colors to distinguish sentiment and classification results.

Place panels logically so the text input is at the top or left, dataset table in the center/right, and analytics below or on the side.

Generate a visual mockup or detailed description of how the UI would look on a Windows screen, including placement of each element, buttons, and panels."
